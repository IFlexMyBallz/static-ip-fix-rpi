##  GUIDE  ##
-------------------------------------------- 
x is used as a placeholder

"#" - This is a comment, Do not paste in Terminal when executing
";" - This is a second comment, occurs when there is 2 comments in one line (See on line 4)
" // \\ " - This is a optional comment, usually is a funfact / recommendation 
"See after "x" nb. x in line x" - to referr to a previously occuring command / comment nb stands for the amount the "x" has occured in the line, if not present then its the first one occuring
"?" - Optional but helpful commment, should be ignored if looking for quick execution but recommended for checking
"!" - Important comment, very recommended to look at
"[+]" - This is an extra about me, you can fully ignore this
The line numbers start after the Guide

My problem and this fix:
        I want to use PiHole for the raspberryPi, and I have encountered an Error for my static IP address so I wanted to find a fix and heres the one I came up with.
            
        ! This sets your IP to static and I have no clue on how to reset this (might add later)
